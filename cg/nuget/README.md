cgmanifest.json is an auto-generated file using the /generateCgManifestForNugets:<path> agrument while using bxl.
Any changes to this file will be over written whenever we run the bxl command.
If you are adding additional NuGet Packages to the project, they will automatically be added in the cgmanifest.json file whenever you build the project using the bxl command.
If you need to add custom entries into a cgmanifest.json file, please create a new file with the name cgmanifest.json in a different folder anywhere within the project, since any changes to the cgmanifest.json in this folder wil always be over-written.
